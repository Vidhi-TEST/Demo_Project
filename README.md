# Demo_Project 

This repository contains the demo project demonstrating a basic tic-tac-toe game and a re-factored to-do list using Python. Additionally, useful configuration files such as .gitignore are included for Node.js projects.

## Installation Guide

### Windows

To get started, you need to have Python installed on your PC. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Install the Python 3.x version that is suitable for your Windows OS version.

To check the Python installation, open the command prompt and type:

```sh
python --version
```

### Mac

Python comes pre-installed on most Mac OS versions. You can verify the Python installation by opening the terminal and typing:

```sh
python3 --version
```

If Python is not installed, you can install it using the Homebrew package manager. If you don't have Homebrew, install it first:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Then install Python:

```sh
brew install python3
```

## Running the Program

To run the programs, navigate to the python directory from the terminal or command prompt:

```sh
cd python
```

To run the tic-tac-toe game:

```sh
python tic-tac-toe.py
```

To run the todo list program:

```sh
python todo.py
```

The Python versions used to develop these scripts are Python 3.x, ensure that you have the corresponding Python interpreter to run these files smoothly.
