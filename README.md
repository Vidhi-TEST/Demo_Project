# Demo_Project 

This is a demo project that includes a Tic Tac Toe game and a basic To-do List implemented in Python. This project also incorporates Git allowing us to enhance our collaboration effectiveness and coordination over software development. Included within the repository is a .gitignore file, which amplifies our software development productivity by reducing the time wasted on unnecessary files.

## Software Requirements

### For MacOS:

- Python (version 3.7 or above)
- Git 

For MacOS, you can download Python and Git from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) and the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) respectively. After installing Python, you can verify the installation by opening Terminal and typing `python3 --version`. You can also verify the Git installation with `git --version` in Terminal.

### For Windows:

- Python (version 3.7 or above)
- Git Bash

For Windows, download Python and Git Bash from [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win) respectively. After installing Python, you can verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing `python --version`. You can also verify the Git installation with `git --version` in Git Bash.

## Setup and Running Locally

1. Clone the repository.
``` 
git clone <repository_link>
```
2. Navigate to directory containing the files.

For Tic-Tac-Toe:
```
cd python
python3 tic-tac-toe.py
```

For Todo List:
```
cd python
python3 todo.py
``` 

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

If there exists any related CI/CD pipeline set up, refer to their specific documentation and instructions for steps to deploy the application.

Always check the code to ensure it's compatible with your CI/CD platform, adjust them if necessary, and always run a test build to ensure everything is running smoothly before the actual production deployment. This allows to quickly address and fix issues if any exist. Remember to refer to your specific CI/CD tools' documentation for their precise syntax, commands, and practices. 

Please note that this is a practice project and is not intended for real production use. There are no databases or external dependencies required to run this project.
