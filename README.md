# Demo_Project

This is a Python project which includes implementations of various algorithms like sorting, calculator operations and games like Stone Paper Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe. It also includes unit tests for these implementations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Python3.

* Install Python for windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
* Install Python for MacOS: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
* You will also need pip (Python package installer), most newer Python versions come with pip pre-installed.

### Installing

1. Clone the project to your local machine using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/Demo_Project.git
   ```
2. Change your working directory into your local repository:
   ```sh
   cd Demo_Project
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages: 
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Python scripts. For example:
   ```sh
   python bubblesort.py
   ```

## Running the tests

Testing in the Python ecosystem is commonly done with the unittest framework. Here are the steps that need to be followed to run unittests.

1. Make sure you are in the folder where the test exists.

2. Run the unittest command followed by the filename:
   ```sh
   python -m unittest filename.py
   ```

## Deployment process

This would depend upon the CI/CD pipeline already setup in your system. If your code repository is part of a CI/CD pipeline then pushing your code changes to the code repository would trigger the pipeline.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
